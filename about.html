      <p id="main-content-about"><a href="resume.html">Resumé</a></p>

      <p>I am a MBA and MSI student at the University of Michigan. <br>
      Born and raised in Brazil, I majored in International Relations with a minor in Business and Marketing. <br>
      I worked for 5 year at Procter & Gamble, in São Paulo, with Marketing Communications, eventually being promoted to Communications Manager for Gillette before moving to the United States for my dual masters.</p>

      <p>Both my undergrad and previous professional experience made me realize how passionate I am about human behavior and my current degrees are geared toward further leveraging such understanding as a positive force in business. I am especially interested in the advances of voice interfaces and their impact on accessibility.</p>

      <p>On a personal level, I am all about learning new languages, good food, great music (ecletic but with a soft spot for classic rock), and lots of quality time with my loved ones.</p>
